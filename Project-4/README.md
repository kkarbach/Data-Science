### Project Motivation
In todayâ€™s competitive marketplace, businesses are constantly seeking to improve customer exposure and to drive sales in innovative ways. This project leverages Starbucks transactional, demographic, and promotional data to develop a machine learning classifier aimed at identifying the key features that predict the success of promotional offers. By analyzing various factors such as customer demographics, promotional engagement, and type of promotions, I aim to uncover actionable insights that can enhance marketing effectiveness. Through this data-driven approach, I hope to refine promotional offer strategies, ultimately driving customer engagement and maximizing revenue for Starbucks.
