### Project Motivation

The motivation for this project is to analyze records of Starbucks' transactional, demographic, and promotional data to develop a machine learning classifier aimed at identifying the key features that predict the success of promotional offers. By analyzing customer demographics, promotional engagement, and various promotional metrics, I aim to determine which factors most impact customer purchasing decisions in a promotional offer.

After uploading and cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis was performed to characterize the data, look for missing data and outliers, and to determine data suitability for a machine learning model. After the data was combined and cleaned, candidate classification models and data transformers were chosen from resources in the scikit-learn documentation. The models were trained and fitted, tuned, and analyzed. Due to the binary nature of the problem (whether or not a customer completed an offer), a logistic regression model turned out to be the most effective. Finally, the model features were analyzed and ranked by importance with the aim of providing insight into the development of new promotional offers.
