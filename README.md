# Project 1: Boston and Seattle Airbnb market analysis

This project looks at Airbnb data sets from the Boston and Seattle markets to answer
 - What is the distribution of property and room types in each market and how do they compare?
 - How does property or room type affect rental price? Do both markets have similar patterns?
 - How does location factor into pricing? Are there any geographical patterns with property and room types?
 - What features of the data most affect the rental price?
